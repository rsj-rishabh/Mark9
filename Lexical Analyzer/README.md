Develop a lexical analyser to recognize a few patterns using regular expression.
Input -> Program file (.txt / .cpp / .doc)
Output -> (a) Lexical units (Lexemes - keywords, identifiers, operators, punctuations, etc.)
         (b) List of identifiers with data type and initial value
         (c) Count of lines and words
         (d) Record of errors with line and word number
         (e) Updated output / target program in (.txt / .cpp / .doc) file (after removal of white      ……………....spaces and comments)
